# Second assignment on distributed systems.

## Structure

The report is located at [doc/report.pdf](doc/report.pdf). All the experiments
are in each directory exp1, exp2, etc.

## Compilation

All the experiments and the doc files are already compiled, as the compilation
time is very long. To generate the figures, all the experiments should run, with 
each configuration for about 3 s.

If you want to recompile everything, first use clean:

	$ make clean

Then just type:

	$ make

## Work in progress

The last 2 experiments were not finished yet. The experiment 3 is yet unstable 
to compile.

## Requeriments

To compile you need python 3, with numpy installed, erlang, a latex environment, 
gnuplot and the coreutils. All the compilation was tested on GNU/Linux.
