# Second assignment on distributed systems.

## Structure

The report is located at [doc/report.pdf](doc/report.pdf). All the experiments
are in each directory exp1, exp2, etc.

## Compilation

All the experiments and the doc files are already compiled, as the compilation
time is very long. To generate the figures, all the experiments should run, with 
each configuration for about 3 s.

If you want to recompile everything, first use clean:

	$ make clean

Then just type:

	$ make

**Warning:** Compilation time takes around 10 minutes.

	make  866,01s user 29,94s system 147% cpu 10:09,45 total

## Work in progress

The last 2 experiments are not finished yet. 

## Requeriments

To compile you need python 3, with numpy installed, erlang, a latex environment, 
gnuplot and the coreutils. All the compilation was tested on GNU/Linux.
