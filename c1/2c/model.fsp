/* The problem with the diagram is that server can respond after a client timeout */

CLIENT = (call -> WAIT),
WAIT = (answer -> continue -> CLIENT | timeout -> CLIENT).

SERVER = (request-> LISTEN),
LISTEN = (timeout -> SERVER | service -> reply -> SERVER).

||CLIENT_SERVER = (CLIENT||SERVER) /{call/request, answer/reply}.
